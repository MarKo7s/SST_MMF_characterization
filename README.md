# Arbitrary Coherence Length Source Multimode Fibre Characterization by Spatial State Tomography

## Intro

Referenceless, arbitrary coherence source multimode fibre characterization using spatial state tomography. The modules contain functions to perform spatial state tompgrahy and retrieve the complete complex mode transmission matrix (MTM). Those functions are shown in the avaliable jupyter notebook examples.



## How to use it

Copy the remote repository in your local machine, the repository is self contained and the custom packages are provided inside modules folder. The custom modules make use of following packages:

- numpy, scipy, pathlib
- cupy, numba (optional for accelation)
